#+title: tesouro.el

Brazilian Portuguese thesaurus for Emacs, queries dicio.com.br using [[https://github.com/ThiagoNelsi/dicio-api][dicio-api]].

Heavily based on [[https://github.com/AnselmC/le-thesaurus.el][github.com/AnselmC/le-thesaurus.el]] (thanks! 😄).

* Installation

tesouro.el is still not in MELPA. I’m still studying how that is done.

* Usage

With your cursor over a word, invoke =M-x tesouro-get-synoynms=. Pick a synonym from the completion buffer and =RET=. tesouro.el does its best to detect if a word is capitalized or uppercase and match its output, but other word cases are not supported yet.

Responses from [[https://dicio.com.br/][dicio.com.br]] are cached; use =tesouro-clear-cache= if you wish to clear the cache.

* Roadmap

- Add package to MELPA.
